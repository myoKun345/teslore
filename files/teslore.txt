<p>
	This is the collection of files which are collected and processed into the CSS that governs /r/teslore. Upon execution of <code>bundle exec rake reddit:compile</code>, the <code>teslore.css.sass.erb</code> file is read by Ruby, which swaps the variable names for the appropriate text before passing it to SASS. SASS reads the <code>@import</code> directives and is informed to search in the /teslore directory rather than the root. SASS collects the files from /teslore, which themselves have <code>@import</code> directives pointed at the subfolders, and once assembled, converts the sheet to CSS. This is stored in <code>build/teslore.css</code>, where the <code>bundle exec rake reddit:push</code> command may receive it and pass it to the CSS entry form of the specified subreddit.
